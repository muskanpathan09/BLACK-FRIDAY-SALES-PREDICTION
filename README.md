# BLACK-FRIDAY-SALES-PREDICTION
Predicting Black Friday sales using linear regression and decision tree models involves using machine learning techniques to analyze historical sales data and make forecasts for future Black Friday sales. Here's an overview of the process:

1. **Data Collection and Preparation**:
   - Gather historical data related to Black Friday sales. This data should include information such as product categories, prices, discounts, customer demographics, and sales figures.
   - Preprocess the data by cleaning it, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Create relevant features that can help the models make accurate predictions. This may involve extracting information from the dataset, such as calculating average discounts, creating dummy variables for categorical features, and more.

3. **Data Splitting**:
   - Split the dataset into a training set and a testing (or validation) set. The training set is used to train the models, while the testing set is used to evaluate their performance.

4. **Linear Regression Model**:
   - Fit a linear regression model to the training data. Linear regression aims to establish a linear relationship between the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (Black Friday sales).

5. **Decision Tree Model**:
   - Train a decision tree model on the same training data. Decision trees partition the data into subsets based on feature values and make predictions based on these partitions.

6. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Use evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess the performance of both the linear regression and decision tree models on the testing set.
   - Compare the performance of the two models to determine which one provides better predictions.

7. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - For the decision tree model, you can perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize its performance. Parameters like the maximum depth of the tree, minimum samples per leaf, and others can be adjusted through techniques like cross-validation.

8. **Prediction**:
   - Once the models are trained and evaluated, you can use them to make predictions for Black Friday sales based on input data. This input data may include features such as product prices, discounts, and customer characteristics.

9. **Visualization**:
   - Visualize the results of your predictions, either as time series plots or other relevant visualizations, to understand trends and patterns in Black Friday sales.

10. **Deployment**:
    - If the models perform well and meet your accuracy requirements, you can deploy them in a production environment where they can be used to make real-time sales predictions for future Black Fridays.

11. **Monitoring and Maintenance**:
    - Continuously monitor the models' performance and update them as needed to account for changing market conditions or data drift.

12. **Interpretation**:
    - Interpret the results and insights gained from the models to inform business decisions, such as adjusting marketing strategies or optimizing inventory management.

Remember that linear regression and decision tree models are just two of many machine learning algorithms you can use for sales prediction. Depending on your data and objectives, you may also explore other techniques like Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks to potentially improve prediction accuracy.
